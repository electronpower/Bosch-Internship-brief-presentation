# Bosch Internship :
This work, carried out within the financial and management department at Bosch Thermotechnology,
is about to process and report the massive data collected throughout the production. This
data concerns mainly customer complaints, the aim is to get value from them. The project is ideally
suited to the field of DATA SCIENCE, specifically in the DATA ANALYSIS, A domain that
currently has huge useful applications and use cases, there is no doubt now that all the industry
4.0 principals are based on it, so it is getting more intentions from the entire industry and research
community.
First of all, we had to prepare standard documents to present all the analytic results, these
standards are demanded by the Bosch group in order to communicate easily the analysis results
between all different Thermotechnology divisions, through these standards we can set easily the
useful data bases and the relevant paths to the most important data information, apparently a
difficulty is remarked when it comes to get involved about the connections taking place in the preexisting
data bases which adds necessary a little bit complexity. After mastering these interactions,
the analysis process will take place, at this level, we wonder which tool is more suitable for our use
case, indeed currently the sexiest tools which go in pairs are R and Python, the choice is focused
on Python because of his ease.
Standalone vba and Python applications have been created to ensure a powerful analysis of
data, and to be used for the future processing.

# Internal and external failure costs:
# Internal failure costs:
Internal failure costs are those costs that are incurred to remove defects from the products before
shipping them to customers. Examples of internal failure costs include cost of rework, rejected
products, scrap etc.
#  External failure costs:
If defective products have been shipped to customers, external failure costs arise. External failure
costs include warranties, replacements, lost sales because of bad reputation, payment for damages
arising from the use of defective products etc. The shipment of defective products can dissatisfy
customers, damage goodwill and reduce sales and profits.
Examples of internal failure cost:
# 
 Net cost of scrap.
 # 
 Rework labor and overhead.
Re-entering data because of keying
# 
Debugging software errors.
# 
Examples of external failure cost:
# 
Cost of field servicing and handling complaints
# 
Warranty repairs and replacement costs
# 
Liability arising from defective products

# Analytical prediction and Problem solving:
The ultimate goal is to anticipate warranty failure and to give a good
start for the problem solving process.
No manufacturer sets out to disappoint—let alone melt—a customer, but defects can exist so most
provide a warranty to keep their customers satisfied. But anticipating warranty costs for a product
or business can be challenging, even risky. Setting aside too little money or too many spare parts
may lead to hardship if an unanticipated problem arises. Setting aside too much money ties up
resources that might be used more effectively elsewhere.
The question is how you can estimate future warranty expenses with confidence, all we need is a
little data! Sorry a lot of data, I had a vision of the number of returns this manufacturer might
receive each month for a year’s boiler production. All they needed to forecast warranty claims in
the coming year was the number of fans shipped over the previous 12 months (or other period),
and the number of each shipment returned each month.
Now I could proceed with my analysis, as long as I didn’t suffer heatstroke before it finished. I
chose Warranty Analysis and then I try to evaluate the Warranty Prediction.
We can anticipate our analysis at different levels: for the ratio of failure product, the price of the
cash loss, failure component, bad suppliers, and the quality of logistics. . .
